**Xania** is (just like react) a javascript view library for building reactive UI with JSX syntax. A typical component in xania has props (properties), a view and event handlers. Unlinke React, client components can be async. Other differences comes from fine-grained reactivity in Xania.

```jsx
async function HelloWorld(props: { children }) {
  const { name } = await fetchProfile();
  return (
    <button click={() => log(`hello ${name}!`)}>
      Say hello
    </button>
  );
}
```


## Key Features

- 🚀 **Blazingly fast:** The fastest implementation in the JavaScript framework benchmark.
- 🔥 **React interop:** Xania components integrates seemlessly in a react application.
- 😎  **Fine-grained reactivity:** No vdom / rerender of the components. Supports observables (e.g. rxjs ) as input from outside world to 
listen to changes and pinpoint the DOM that needs to update without recreating the DOM.
- ⏰ **Async everywhere:** First class support for async components or any part of it, async update commands, async derived state, async everything, etc....
