**Xania** is (just like react) a javascript view library for building reactive UI with JSX syntax. Unlinke React, client components can be async. Also state can be async too. This greately simplifies how we write 'React' code.

```jsx
async function HelloWorld(props: { children }) {
  const { name } = await fetchProfile();
  return (
    <button click={() => log(`hello ${name}!`)}>
      Say hello
    </button>
  );
}
```


## Key Features

- 🚀 **Blazingly fast:** The fastest implementation in the JavaScript framework benchmark.
- 🔥 **React interop:** Xania components integrates seemlessly in a react application.
- 😎  **Fine-grained reactivity:** No vdom / rerender of the components. Supports observables (e.g. rxjs ) as input from outside world to 
listen to changes and pinpoint the DOM that needs to update without recreating the DOM.
- ⏰ **Async everywhere:** First class support for async components or any part of it, async update commands, async derived state, async everything, etc....
