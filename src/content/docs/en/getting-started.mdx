<h2>What is Xania?</h2>

Xania is javascript view library for building reactive UI with JSX syntax. 

## Key Features

- **Blazingly fast:** The fastest implementation in the JavaScript framework benchmark.
- **React interop:** Xania components integrates seemlessly in a react application.
- **Fine-grained reactivity:** No rerender of the components. Supports observables (e.g. rxjs ) as input from outside world, and leverates (arrowized) frp for updating view on state change.
- **Async everywhere:** First class support for async components or any part of it, async update messages, async derived state, etc....
