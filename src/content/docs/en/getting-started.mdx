<h2>What is Xania?</h2>

**Xania** is javascript view library for building reactive UI with JSX syntax. 

```jsx
function HelloWorld(props: { name, children }) {
  const { name } = props;
  return (
    <button click={() => log(`hello ${name}!`)}>
      Say hello
    </button>
  );
}
```


## Create your first xania

 √ title · my-project

## Key Features

🚀 **Blazingly fast:** The fastest implementation in the JavaScript framework benchmark.

🔥 **React interop:** Xania components integrates seemlessly in a react application.

😎  **Fine-grained reactivity:** No vdom / rerender of the components. Supports observables (e.g. rxjs ) as input from outside world to 
listen to changes and pinpoint the DOM that needs to update without recreating the DOM.

⏰ **Async everywhere:** First class support for async components or any part of it, async update commands, async derived state, async everything, etc....
