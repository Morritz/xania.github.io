import { Counter } from "~/xania/Counter";
import { HelloWorld } from "~/xania/HelloWorld";
import { DoubleCounter } from "~/xania/DoubleCounter";
import { PokemonProfile } from  "~/xania/PokemonProfile";
import { PokemonApp } from "~/xania/PokemonApp";

Next example will shows an example of dynamic view that depends on state that change over time. the changes are initiated via the click event.

```jsx
function Counter() {
  // 1 state
  const count = state(1);
  // 2 update
  const increment = count.update((x) => x + 1)
  // 3 view
  return (
    <button click={increment}>
      Count: { count }
    </button>
  );
}
```
<Counter client:only="xania"  />

#### 1 state(...)

```jsx
  const count = state(1);
```

First we create a state with initial value of `1`. Naming is hard, `count` is not exactly a state object in the traditional sense, we cannot just peek into it to see the latest value after incrementing the count a couple of times. The actual value is stored and maintained in the xania runtime. the only way to access it's value is using update commands / messages

#### 2 update(...)
```jsx
  const increment = update(count, (x) => x + 1)
```
`button` Element binds the *click* event to the `increment` update command. Technically, `increment` is just a plain data object that describes how `count` change over time, it is also a special type of object which **Xania** accepts, instead of a callback function like we saw before in *Hello World* example.

When triggered, **Xania** runtime will execute the `increment` to update the runtime state of the `count` and update the text content of the button accordingly.
